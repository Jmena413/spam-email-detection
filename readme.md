# Spam Email Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect spam emails using the SMS Spam Collection dataset.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `exploration.ipynb` to see the project workflow

## Usage
- Preprocess data using `src/data_preprocessing.py`
- Extract features using `src/feature_extraction.py`
- Train and evaluate the model using `src/model.py`

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks
- `src/`: Source code
- `models/`: Trained models
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

## Results
